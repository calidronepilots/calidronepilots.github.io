Let's face it, it’s expensive and sometimes dangerous to deploy equipment and personnel to inspect equipment and property. Leveraging skilled drone aerial operators to view and record inspections can dramatically increase safety, lower costs, and speed up inspections. We work with Roofing Building Inspectors and infrastructure managers to customize aerial photography solutions that provide the required information to make decisions.

Drone recorded aerial photos video & can provide critical panoramic 360-degree views from many angles that contribute an overall perspective of the construction site and the progress being made. It can also present critical documentation and photographic evidence that serves as proof of activities that were performed.
Investigation
Evidence Collection | Surveillance 
We all know privacy is an important aspect of our society. However, there are times when conducting surveillance from a safe discreet view to collect critical evidence without being detected is necessary. Gathering evidence and proof can also be critical in supporting or disputing insurance claims. There is no better way to recording aerial video and capturing photos that back up your claims than from a UAV.

Traditional methods such as helicopters, planes, and cranes often take too long to arrange & set up and come with an expensive price tag. Drone aerial video & photo footage can be captured in a fraction of the time and at a lower cost, providing 4K resolution that fits many media standards.
Documentation
Video | Photographic 
In days gone by, documentation was often transcribed from handwritten notes or voice recordings and occasionally supported by a photograph taken on a handheld camera or cell phone. Today aerial video footage can provide indisputable supporting documentation of an area and it’s location. Cameras mounted on Drones & UAVs enable us to gather this documentation for you quickly and cost-effectively.
Agriculture | Farming in california
Technology has revolutionized farming many times over in the last century. Monitoring crops from the air will provide the next capability to carefully and accurately evaluate the land and growth of your crops. Using a drone or UAV we can capture highly accurate images of your fields, covering many hectares|acres in a single flight giving farmers new ways to increase yields and reduce crop damage.
Drones can provide farmers with several types of detailed views. Viewing the crop from the air can reveal patterns that expose irrigation problems, soil variation, and pest and fungal infestations that aren’t easy to see at ground level. Airborne cameras can capture data from the infrared to highlight healthy or distressed plants. Drones can survey a crop every week, every day without lengthy drives to and from the land providing more opportunities for better crop management.
